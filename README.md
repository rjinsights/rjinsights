Hi There! ðŸ‘‹ <h1>ðŸš€ About Me</h1>

Greetings and welcome to my LinkedIn profile.

I'm Rajasekar Nonburaj, currently serving as the Business Head for BI & Analytics at Trivecta Digital. In my role, I lead client projects in data analytics, AI/ML, and data engineering. Over the course of my career spanning more than two decades, I have accumulated extensive expertise as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the field of Data and Analytics.

My primary area of expertise revolves around Solution Architecture. Within this capacity, I specialize in overseeing large-scale global BI deployments, effectively managing project deliveries, and playing a pivotal role in establishing Centers of Excellence (COE) within the Business Intelligence and Analytics domain.My work has a global reach, as evidenced by the robust client relationships I've cultivated across the US, EMEA, and APAC regions. I've had the opportunity to lead projects in countries such as the United States, Australia, UAE, and Mexico, which speaks to my deep passion for this field.

In prior roles, I've collaborated extensively with renowned BI and analytics vendors, including SAP, Infor, Birst, and Sisense, making substantial contributions to their development, training, support, and delivery endeavors. Beyond my professional accomplishments, I hold certifications in Data Science from the Great Lakes Institute of Management, in addition to certifications in project management and agile coaching. I'm proud to have my contributions recognized, and I am deeply honored to be acknowledged as a prominent figure in the domain of big data and analytics. I've been humbled by being voted as one of the top thought leaders in this field by Analyticsweek and also voted as the Top Datascience Voice on LinkedIn.

I'm always excited to engage with fellow data enthusiasts, regardless of whether you're an experienced expert or a passionate student. I'm enthusiastic about the prospect of connecting with you and exploring potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out if you share an interest in diving into subjects such as Data Analytics, AI/ML, or higher education, or if you have creative concepts you'd like to turn into reality.
